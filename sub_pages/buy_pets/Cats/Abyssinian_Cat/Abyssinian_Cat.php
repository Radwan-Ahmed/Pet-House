        <h2>More about  AbyssinianCat</h2>
        <p>
        Known for their unique ticked coat, Abyssinians have the appearance of a wildcat. They are athletic, alert, very active, and intensely curious with all that surrounds them. Fiercely loyal and highly people oriented, Abyssinians are referred to as the cat of the pet world. They are generally great with children, dogs, and other cats.

Activity Level:
Abyssinians are extremely graceful, lithe, and elegant. They show a lively interest in their surroundings and are famous for their playful and curious disposition. Most Abys will stay kitten-like throughout much of their life.

Abys prefer the highest ground they can reach. They love to be on the highest level possible where they are able to observe the room, make decisions, and even guard their family. Don’t be stunned if you find a “flying” Aby on your shoulder!

  <h2>Health</h2>
  <p>
  Abyssinians are generally healthy, but as with all breeds, they are prone to certain health conditions. While knowledgeable breeders do their best to test for and eliminate genetic health problems, cats may still develop certain diseases or conditions. Abyssinians may have a higher risk for the following:

  <h2>Grooming</h2>
  <p>
  Abyssinians are known to many as the “wash and wear” cat. Their grooming requirements are low as they shed very little and have a short, easy-to-maintain coat. An occasional brushing is all that is required to eliminate dead hair and an intermittent rub down with a cold damp cloth will also help to keep their coat glossy and in good condition. Bathe as needed, starting when your Aby is a kitten. After bathing, pat down with a towel and leave the coat to “drip-dry” on its own.

  Nails should be trimmed every two weeks. Begin brushing their teeth regularly at an early age with a vet-approved pet toothpaste.

  As with all cats, it is important to give your cat fresh, clean water daily. Fresh, clean water is best, so cats don’t hesitate to drink. If you worry about your cat drinking enough water each day, here's a tip from some cat behaviorists: place the water bowl at least three feet away from any food. Cats’ noses are sensitive, and an overwhelming smell of food may cause them to drink less. Filtered drinking fountains (stainless steel preferred) can also be used in place of a water bowl.
