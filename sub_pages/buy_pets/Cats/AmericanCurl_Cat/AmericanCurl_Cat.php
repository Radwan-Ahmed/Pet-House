        <h2>More about American Curl Cat</h2>
        <p>
        Lovable and curious, American Curls love spending time with their families and participating in their every move, like unpacking groceries or watching TV. They love attention and being talked to, but are not noisy cats. They make a quiet “cooing” sound when they talk to their families and quietly nudge them for attention.
        They love to greet their families with a soft bump to the head and show affection by patting and nuzzling against its owner’s face. Naturally clever and inquisitive, the Curl often spends a considerable amount of time exploring its environment or playing games.

  <h2>Grooming</h2>
  <p>
  American Curls can be either longhair or shorthair. Shorthair Curls should be brushed regularly with a grooming glove or soft brush. Longhaired Curls do not have much undercoat, but should be brushed occasionally. Less undercoat means less shedding and less maintenance.
  Nails should be trimmed periodically with a clipper (it is not recommended to use the scissor clippers). Curls are known to have a black ear wax that is normal for the breed therefor the inside of their ears should be clean periodically. Brush their teeth with a vet-approved pet toothpaste for good overall health and fresh breath and schedule regular veterinary dental cleanings.

  <h2>Exercise</h2>
  <p>
  They enjoy daily exercise and can entertain themselves with just about anything left on the floor. Cat trees and indoor perches are recommended for climbing and jumping. They love to play and can even learn to fetch, but when they are ready for a break they will happily settle onto the nearest lap.

  <h2>Training</h2>
<p>
Curls are playful and known as the “Peter Pan” of the cat world because they retain their kitten-like playfulness into their later years.
