        <h2>More about American Bobtail Cat</h2>
     <p>
     Confident and friendly, the American Bobtail is a highly intelligent breed with a clown-like personality. Despite their wild expression similar to that of a bobtailed wildcat, this rare and athletic breed is friendly and affectionate. Their subtle personality that is warm and loving rather than demanding or in your face. They are good travelers and make wonderful therapy cats.

One of the breed’s most unusual traits is their shortened tail. No two tails are identical so they are truly the hallmark of the individual and are proudly held above the back when the cat is alert, often wagging to express the cat's mood.

Bobtails aren’t as vocal as some breeds and tend to communicate their pleasure with chirps, clicks and trills, as well as the standard purr and meow.

A devoted family companion, American Bobtails make great family pets. They get along well with older children as well as other pets, including the family pet.

  <h2>Grooming</h2>
  <p>
  The American Bobtail’s coat doesn’t usually mat or tangle as long as it is combed or brushed a couple of times a week to remove dead hair and keep his coat healthy and shiny. Bobtails tend to shed more in the spring and fall, so it can be a good idea to groom them more frequently during those times. However, a bath is rarely necessary unless they’ve gotten into something messy.

As with all cats, keep their nails trimmed every couple of weeks and teeth brushed regularly with a vet-approved toothpaste.

Be sure to wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection.

Check their ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.

  <h2>Training</h2>
  <p>
  The American Bobtail is a highly intelligent breed. Most are moderately active without being either a couch potato or constantly in motion. They can easily be taught to walk on a leash and play fetch. Challenge their brain by teaching them tricks and providing puzzle toys that reward with kibble or treats when they learn how to manipulate them
