        <h2>More about Bombay Cat</h2>
        <p>
        Bombay cats love human interaction and being the center of attention. They are a true part of the family and like to be involved in everything, including walking around perched on their owner’s soldier or cuddled in their lap as they watch TV or read a book, they’ve even been known to join their humans under the covers at bedtime. The lively and affectionate Bombay is adaptable to many different environments and lifestyles.

  <h2>Health</h2>
  <p>
  The Bombay is generally a healthy breed but, as with all cats, they are at risk for the most common heart disease, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. This is a genetic disease that can result in heart failure and death, so it is of paramount importance that breeders diligently screen for this via echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) performed by a Veterinary Cardiologist. Because HCM doesn’t always show up in the first years of life, it is important for pet owners to proactively screen for this disease as well.
  Knowledgeable breeders will DNA test their breeding cats for defects (BHD, HK and GM2) that can occur in the breed. HK and GM2, which are the only ones that may affect pet buyers, are mainly seen in lines that originate in Europe, but as the genetic tests have been available for several years now, these defects have almost been eliminated.

  <h2>Grooming</h2>
  <p>
  The Bombay’s short, fine coat sheds little and is easy to care for by brushing weekly. Sometimes they will only require running a chamois over their coat to remove lose hairs and bring a silky sheen to their coat. Bathing is not necessary but can be done a couple of times each year.
  As with all cats, keep their nails trimmed, ears cleaned, and teeth brushed regularly with a vet-approved pet toothpaste and provide a nice tall scratching pole to help their natural scratching instinct.

  <h2>Exercise</h2>
  <p>
  The Bombay is a smart cat who loves to play. As kittens they are very active and curious and adapt easily to change. It is recommended to kitten-proof homes with Bombay kittens. As they get older, they tend to become more tranquil, preferring to watch rather than get involved in activities

  <h2>Nutrition</h2>
  <p>
  The Bombay is a sturdy, stocky cat. Exercise and a high-quality diet are key to keeping them healthy. Like all cats, Bombay’s are active cats and need mostly animal protein/meat in their diet. Canned food twice a day and a quality dry food with no corn or wheat. Avoid grains if possible. Give them dry food with high level of animal protein to maintain the muscle mass and fatty acids to maintain a healthy skin and shiny coat. If using dry food, avoid foods with a lot of grains, leave some out daily to free feed. Kittens require quality food to put on muscle as they grow.
  As with all cats, it is important to give your cat fresh, clean water daily. Fresh, clean water is best, so cats don’t hesitate to drink. If you worry about your cat drinking enough water each day, here's a tip from Jackson Galaxy and other cat behaviorists - Place the water bowl at least three feet away from any food. Cats’ noses are sensitive, and an overwhelming smell of food may cause them to drink less. Filtered drinking fountains can also be used in place of a water bowl.
