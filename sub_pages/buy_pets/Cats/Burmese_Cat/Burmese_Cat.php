        <h2>More about Burmese Cat</h2>
        <p>
        A sweet and charming cuddler, the Burmese is an outgoing, people-oriented cat that loves to curl up on any available lap. They are playful cats and their playful nature extends to joining the games of the youngest family members, easily tolerating being dressed up in doll's clothes and carried around like a living doll. They are very social cats that thrive on the company of others, thus they tend to become lonely if left by themselves for long periods of time. They have a soft voice and enjoy talking with their families about the events of their day.

  <h2>Health</h2>
  <p>
  The Burmese is generally a healthy breed but, as with all cats, they are at risk for the most common heart disease, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. This is a genetic disease that can result in heart failure and death, so it is of paramount importance that breeders diligently screen for this via echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) performed by a Veterinary Cardiologist. Because HCM doesn’t always show up in the first years of life, it is important for pet owners to proactively screen for this disease as well.

  <h2>Exercise</h2>
  <p>
  Highly intelligent, Burmese cats thrive with families who are willing to teach them tricks, play games and provide plenty of puzzle or interactive toys. They do best with families who give them plenty of attention and get along well with children and other pets. They are extremely people-oriented and tolerant cats that are an ideal pet for the whole family, including younger children. The Burmese will happily join in games and play the role of living doll.

  <h2>Nutrition</h2>
  <p>
  Exercise and a high-quality diet are key to keeping a Burmese healthy.
  As with all cats, it is important to give your cat fresh, clean water daily. Fresh, clean water is best, so cats don’t hesitate to drink. If you worry about your cat drinking enough water each day, here's a tip from Jackson Galaxy and other cat behaviorists - Place the water bowl  at least three feet away from any food. Cats’ noses are sensitive and an overwhelming smell of food may cause them to drink less. Filtered drinking fountains can also be used in place of a water bowl.
