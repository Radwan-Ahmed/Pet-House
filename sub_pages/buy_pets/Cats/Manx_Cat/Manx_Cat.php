        <h2>More about Manx Cat</h2>
        <p>
        These even-tempered, calm cats have a lot of affection to share and prefer not be on their own for long periods of time. The friendly, loving Manx is best known for their taillessness and have been known to carry on a conversation in a sweet trilling voice. They generally will bond most closely with the person who feeds them yet are great family cats. They are able to entertain themselves, are trustworthy if left alone for work hours, and so happy when family returns.
        Some Manx cats give all their love to a single person while others are affectionate toward the entire family, including children..

  <h2>Exercise</h2>
  <p>
  Often compared to a mini race car driver, they tend to accelerate through the house, making sharp turns and quick stops. Gentle and playful, Manx cats are excellent jumpers and have the ability to get to the highest corner to investigate something that has sparked their interest. Given that ability, the mature Manx is often a floor model. Manx cats are highly intelligent. Challenge their brain by teaching them tricks and providing puzzle toys that will reward with kibble or treats. It’s not unusual to find a Manx playing fetch or carrying their toys around. The are known to drown their toys in their water dish, so be prepared for water changes!

  <h2>Nutrition</h2>
  <p>
  Manx cats are best fed wet meals. Twice, daily meals are preferable, although some may only want to eat once a day. Meal feeding also keeps you aware of their health, if someone does not show for a meal, you know to go looking. These obligate carnivores should be fed a meat-based diet, grain free and veg free, too. They really have no way to use those foods, given the short gut and gut flora they have, which can cause gut issues and even excessive dental tartar.
  Their desert origins have made them get most of their liquid from their prey. The mouth is not adapted for taking in water well enough to counter a dry diet. The brain is not “hard-wired” to even drink often, however, as with all cats, it is important to give your cat fresh, clean water daily so cats don’t hesitate to drink. If you worry about your cat drinking enough water each day, here's a tip from cat behaviorists - place the water bowl at least three feet away from any food. Cats’ noses are sensitive and an overwhelming smell of food may cause them to drink less. Filtered drinking fountains can also be used in place of a water bowl.
