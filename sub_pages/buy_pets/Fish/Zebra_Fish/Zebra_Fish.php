        <h2>More about Zebra Fish</h2>
        <p>
        Zebra danios are a favorite of freshwater fish hobbyists because of their ease of care. They are also prolific breeders and the easiest type of egglayers to breed. With its attractively striped, black and white zebra-patterned body, these fish are easy to recognize. Zebrafish are very durable and can withstand an impressive range of water temperatures and conditions. They will generally do just fine without a water heater as they are comfortable at temperatures down to the low 60s F. Unlike most fish species, they are loyal to their breeding partner and mate for life.

  <h2>Origin and Distribution</h2>
  <p>
  Zebra danios were originally thought to have originated from a wider range that stretched from Myanmar in the east and Pakistan in the west; however, the current consensus is that this species originates from a much narrower range that is contained to parts of India and Bangladesh. 
  Part of this change in distribution is due to the identification of similar species that were once misidentified as being Danio rerio. Damage to the environment that resulted in a reduction of habitable areas has also narrowed their natural range, even though wild zebra danios utilize a variety of habitats, ranging from fast-moving streams to slow-moving, nearly stagnant ponds.
  Zebra danios available in the aquarium industry are now almost always captive-bred as zebras are easy and inexpensive to raise. While commercial breeding has provided a large and unlimited supply of this species, it has also resulted in a fish that is less robust than the original wild species.

  <h2>Colors and Markings</h2>
  <p>
  The zebra danio is easily recognized by its distinctive horizontal stripes. Blue-purple horizontal stripes run from gill to tail, setting off the slim, compressed, silver-gold body of this attractive fish.
  Albino, golden, veil-tailed and long-finned zebra danio varieties are available, as well as a popular leopard variety. The leopard strain is characterized by a sprinkling of black spots over the entire body. In the past, the leopard danio was considered a different species, but genetic studies have proven that it is merely a spotted variation of Danio rerio.

  <h2>Tankmates</h2>
  <p>
  The small size of the zebra danio, no more than two and a half inches, makes them well suited to a community aquarium. Zebra danios are a peaceful fish that get along with most tankmates, however, they will nip fins of some species. Any fish with long flowing fins, such as angelfish, bettas, and guppies, are potential targets of the active zebra danio. Good potential tankmates may include barbs, corydoras catfish, similar-sized gouramis, loaches, and swordtails. 
  All varieties thrive in schools and should never be kept as singles. They do best when kept in a school of five or more of their own kind. Groups of this fish can be hierarchal, and a pecking order may emerge in the school, but there is no infighting. Select tankmates that are similar in temperament and that can keep up with the fast-paced behavior of this danio. Mellower fish that need a less hectic environment can become stressed in their presence.

  <h2>Zebra Danio Habitat and Care</h2>
  <p>
  Zebras are primarily surface-dwelling fish that favor moving waters. Technically considered a cold-water fish, this fish prefers water in the 64 to 75 F range. However, they will adapt to a wide range of water conditions. If water temperatures are kept too low, they tend to become more susceptible to disease.
  Zebras are extremely active, and although they have a preference for the upper levels of the aquarium, they will move throughout the entire tank. Provide them with diffuse lighting and an open swimming space with vegetation around the periphery of the habitat. A darker color substrate will help showcase the color of these fish and gives the habitat a more natural feel.

  <h2>Zebra Danio Diet and Feeding</h2>
  <p>
  Zebra danios are omnivorous, accepting almost any foods. Although undemanding in diet, they particularly enjoy small, live or frozen invertebrates and fresh vegetable matter.
</p>

<section class="more-about">
  <h2>Gender Differences</h2>
  <p>
  Both sexes have two pairs of barbels and the same stripes, but females are usually larger. Males are a bit smaller and more slender than females. Male zebras appear more torpedo-shaped, while females tend to have a larger belly. More full-bodied than the males, a female's belly balloons when it fills with eggs.
